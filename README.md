# Basic-Magic
BasicMagic is an android application created to provide useful tools for Magic the Gathering players which are used during a regular game of Magic. The name – BasicMagic came from the idea that an application with these features could be very helpful for players who have just started exploring the game. The application was developed using Java and Android Studio. BasicMagic adopts a navigation drawer in order to navigate through the programme which contains five fragments. The first segment is a life counter which helps players track their current life totals. The next fragment contains three different types of dice, used to determine which player starts first and help during the game with some of the players’ decisions. The third fragment of the navigation drawer contains a list of the general rules which if followed go into detail about each rule of the game. The fourth section consists of six different videos which are around 10 minutes long that explain the rules of the game. The last fragment contains a round timer which indicates when a player must finish their turn.
